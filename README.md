# Ransomware_Detection

## Ransomware Detection through API Call Analysis  
This project is aimed at detecting ransomware by analyzing the API calls performed by the running processes. This is done by monitoring the process behavior in real-time and extracting the relevant information regarding the API calls made by the processes. The information is then analyzed using machine learning algorithms to identify the malicious behavior and classify the processes as either ransomware or benign.
