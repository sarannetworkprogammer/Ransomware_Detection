"""
This code uses the psutil library to retrieve a list of process IDs and inspect each process
to see if its name or executable path contains the word "enum". This is a very simple approach 
and may not detect all instances of the EnumProcesses API being called. More advanced techniques, such as using system 
hooks or process monitoring tools, may be needed to detect all instances of the EnumProcesses API being called.
